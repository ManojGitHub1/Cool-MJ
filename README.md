## 💫 About Me

Software developer with a passion for creating elegant solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source, or enjoying a good cup of Black Coffee while solving algorithm puzzles.

```javascript
const manoj = {
  code: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "Flutter", "C++", "C"],
  askMeAbout: ["web dev", "mobile apps", "machine learning", "devops", "cloud"],
  technologies: {
    frontEnd: {
      js: ["Angular", "React"],
      css: ["Tailwind", "Bootstrap"]
    },
    backEnd: {
      java: ["Springboot"]
      js: ["Node", "Express"],
      dart: ["DartForg"]
    },
    databases: ["MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "Redis"],
    cloud: ["AWS", "Docker", "GCP", "Kubernetes"]
  },
  currentFocus: "Building scalable applications with clean architecture",
  funFact: "I sometimes explain my bugs to an inanimate object... and it fixes itself. Rubber Duck Debugging is real magic. (yes, I talk to a rubber duck) 🐤✨"
};
```

## 🧙‍♂️ Developer Superpowers I gained

- 🛠️ I can debug faster than my coffee cools down (well, most days).
- ⌨️ My code editor has seen more emotions than my diary.
- 👀 I can detect a missing semicolon from across the room.
- 🧰 I can break something just by trying to fix something else — precision chaos.
- 🧠 I know exactly when to restart the system and pretend it was my plan all along.


## 🚀 What I Believe In

- **Clean Code** - Because future-me deserves kindness too
- **Continuous Learning** - The moment I stop learning, my code starts aging
- **Problem First, Technology Second** - Hype-driven development? No thanks.
- **Open Source** - My way of paying rent for the knowledge I borrowed from the internet


## 💡 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **FlashChat** - A real-time messaging app built using Flutter & Firebase. Chat faster than you think
- **Fitness tracker** - Tracker your fitness and be regular, You are your highest priority
- **Awesome Portfolio** - This very site! Yes, the pixel-perfection took a few late nights.


## 🌱 Currently Learning

- I'm currently diving deeper into **Cloud Architecture** also exploring that scary-sounding world of **“Kubernetes”** — which I now pronounce correctly, kind of..
- I don't always know what I'm doing... But Time is the Greatest Teacher, and I'm a Loyal student.


## 🔄 My Developer Workflow (Mostly)
```
$ git clone --black_coffee
$ code .
$ git commit -m "initial panic"
$ git push && pray
```


## 🧠 Quick Dev Thoughts
- // TODO: Stop coding at 2AM
- // FIXME: Figure out why this works before deploying
- // HACK: This shouldn't work, but it does. Don’t touch it.


## 😂 Dev Fun Facts
- 🧩 I once solved a bug by restarting the PC... turns out the real bug was my sleep schedule.
- 🪄 I once fixed a bug by accident, then documented it like I meant it all along. 😅😅😅
- 🧼 I renamed final_v2_real_final_updated.js to please_work_this_time.js.
- 👶 I once explained what an API is... to my dog. He now barks in JSON.
- 💥 Once deployed to production on a Friday. I’m now legally not allowed to do that again.
