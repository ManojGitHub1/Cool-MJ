## 💫 About Me

Software developer with a passion for creating elegant solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source, or enjoying a good cup of coffee while solving algorithm puzzles.

```javascript
const manoj = {
  code: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "Flutter"],
  askMeAbout: ["web dev", "mobile apps", "machine learning", "devops"],
  technologies: {
    frontEnd: {
      js: ["React", "Vue"],

    },
    backEnd: {
      js: ["Node", "Express"],
      python: ["Django", "Flask"]
    },
    databases: ["MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL"],

  },
  currentFocus: "Building scalable applications with clean architecture",
  funFact: "I debug code through rubber duck debugging (yes, I talk to a rubber duck)"
};
```

## 🚀 What I Believe In

- **Clean Code** - Readability is more important than cleverness
- **Continuous Learning** - The tech world never stops evolving, neither do I
- **Problem First, Technology Second** - Choose the right tool for the job
- **Open Source** - Giving back to the community that taught me so much

## 💡 Projects I'm Proud Of

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I'm currently diving deeper into **Cloud Architecture** and **Don't know ecactly what i'm doing**. I believe in the power of Time. Time is the Greatest Teacher. So, basically i'm student of Time, and this is what i'm currently learning.
