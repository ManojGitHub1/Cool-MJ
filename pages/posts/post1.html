        Every developer has their origin story, the moment a spark of curiosity ignites into a full-blown passion. For me, it wasn't a single event, but a gradual realization that the web was more than just a collection of pages—it was a canvas for creation. My journey started with a simple question: "How does this actually work?"
      </p>
      
      <h3>The "Aha!" Moment</h3>
      <p>
        I remember spending an entire weekend trying to get a simple piece of JavaScript to work. It was a frustrating, coffee-fueled blur of trial and error. But when that alert box finally popped up with the text "Hello, World!", the feeling was electric. In that moment, I understood the power of code: the ability to give the browser instructions and see it come to life.

      <!-- This is how you share a code snippet -->
      <h4>An Example Code Block:</h4>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// The simple function that started it all
function greetUser() {
  const userName = prompt("What is your name?");
  if (userName) {
    alert(`Hello, ${userName}! Welcome.`);
  }
}</code></pre>

      <h3>Embracing the Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, it wasn't all smooth sailing. I've spent countless hours debugging, facing cryptic error messages, and questioning my sanity. But every challenge overcome was a lesson learned. Every bug squashed was a victory that made me a better, more resilient developer. This journey is one of continuous learning, and that's what makes it so exciting.
