          <h2>I build digital experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and beautiful.</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into technology began not with a line of code, but with a curiosity for how things work. I was fascinated by the ability to build something from nothingâ€”an idea transformed into a tangible, interactive product that could be used by people anywhere in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, that curiosity drives me. I'm a developer who thrives on the challenge of solving complex problems with clean, elegant solutions. I believe that the best products are born from a deep understanding of user needs and a relentless pursuit of technical excellence.
